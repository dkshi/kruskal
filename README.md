# Kruskal desktop app
This application visually demonstrates the Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph.

## Used packages:
- <a href="https://networkx.org/">networkx</a> for graphs manipulation
- <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a> as interface for app
- <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for graph drawing

## Application features:

- Ability to add and remove edges
- Ability to make screen bigger
- Clear the screen
- Run Kruskal's algorithm: the original graph will be displayed, and different groups of vertices will be highlighted in different colors to understand how the algorithm worked.
